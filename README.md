#Tic Tac Toe 

- this is a command line game I wrote for my application to the Recurse Center
- you can run it with python 3 `python3 tictactoe.py`
- right now it supports 2 player games
- I am hoping I will make it to the pair programming interview during which I will add the computer functionality to support 1 player games
